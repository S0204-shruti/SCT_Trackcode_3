# SCT_Trackcode_3

This Tic Tac Toe project demonstrates a complete interactive game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing fundamental front-end web development skills.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The code creates a classic Tic Tac Toe game where users can select between two modes: Two Players (local multiplayer) and vs Computer (single-player with a simple AI). The interface includes a mode selection screen, a responsive 3x3 grid board, status messages, and controls to restart the game.

The game logic handles player turns, win/draw detection, and dynamically updates the UI to reflect the current state. The computer opponent makes random valid moves when playing in single-player mode.                                                                                                                                                   Key Points Learned and Used:
